# Grimoire of Growth — Vision

**Last updated:** 2025-08-12 (UTC)

A cozy Android habit-RPG you can build entirely from mobile. No monetization, no loot boxes — just progression, story, and tools that help real life feel like an adventure.

## Core Loop
1) Log habits/quests ➜ 2) Earn XP, gold, and items ➜ 3) Upgrade your character/town ➜ 4) Unlock new chapters, map areas, and narrative arcs.

## Pillars
- **Kotlin Android app** (AGP 7.4.2, Gradle 7.6, JDK 17, compileSdk 33, minSdk 26)
- **Mobile-first dev** (Termux + GitHub Actions for APKs)
- **Respect for players**: privacy, offline-friendly, exportable data, zero monetization.

## Systems (MVP ➜ 1.0 path)
- AI-assisted reward suggestions & stacking
- Journey-based chapters (~60-day arcs)
- Quantity goals & long-term mastery (e.g., “Brew 100 teas”)
- Journaling & mood logs that can branch narrative
- Sabbatical mode (pause without streak loss)
- Interactive map dashboard; Pomodoro mini-battles
- Themes & accessibility; exportable analytics
- Seasonal events; mentor NPC; meta-achievements

## Factions & Reputation
Towns are alive with **~12 factions** (e.g., City Guard, Monastic Order, Alchemists’ Guild, Merchants’ Consortium, Rangers, Artisans, Archivists, Healers, Explorers, Shipwrights, Astronomers, Couriers).  
Daily habits translate into **faction reputation** — complete guard-style tasks (discipline, fitness, patrol walks) to earn Guard rep; mindful routines build Monastic rep, etc.

**How it works**
- Each habit can (optionally) tag a primary faction.
- Completing a habit grants base XP + **rep** for that faction; streaks apply multipliers.
- Rep ranks unlock **perks** (discounts, fast-travel, crafting benches, NPC allies, town titles).
- Weekly co-op bounties let parties pool progress to unlock faction festivals or town upgrades.
- Narrative reacts to standing: doors open, prices change, rumors spread; rival factions may offer counter-quests.

**No monetization, ever.** Progress is earned purely through play and consistency.
